		<h1>Is a hotdog a sandwich?</h1>
		<p>Everyone has had a hotdog at least once. If one has been to any decent barbecue, there was a hotdog somewhere. This American staple has been traced all the way back to the Roman emperor Nero around 60 AD where before the hotdog came the sausage. The sausage is composed of minced meat, spices and wheat inside of a pigs intestine. The sausage then travelled through Europe and reached Germany where the common sausage was developed. 
In the mid nineteenth century, a large wave of German immigrants to the United States brought with them sausage with a bun. To this day, Germans and Austrian still fight for the rightful creators of the more commonly known hot dog. 
</p>
		<p>In its origin, the sausage was eaten on its own or part of a meal but never with a bun. The addition of the bun with the sausage came right before the sausage was brought to America. Was it for convenience or, dare I say, making it more sandwich-like. Once the hotdog made its way to New york, everyone was eating hotdogs. They were so popular that The History’s article Break Out the Buns: The History of the Hot Dog  states that “President Franklin Roosevelt hosted King George VI of England and his queen at a picnic in Hyde Park in 1939, first lady Eleanor decided to make grilled hot dogs part of the menu,” (History). 
</p>
		<p>A sandwich’s main purpose is to be hand held. It makes eating a meal simple and fast. A sandwich is usually composed of the bread, the meat, maybe some vegetables or sauces and then the top piece of bread. A hot dog is hand held as well, is composed of a bun exterior and can be served with condiments and toppings. Hence, does that make it a sandwich because it has similarities in its composition or layering? To say that a hot dog is a sandwich is like saying a burrito and a sushi roll are the same. For something to become a sandwich, there has to be bread on top and on the bottom of the meat. Unfortunately, the hotdog does not fit this description because of how it is traditionally held and eaten by  most which is with the open face of the bun facing upwards. 
</p>
		
		<p>This positioning of the meat at the centre of a folded piece of bread reminded me of another very popular meal called the taco. The taco is a Mexican staple which got adapted in America around the late nineteenth century and beginning twentieth century, not so long after the hotdog (Smithsonian). This American adaptation of the taco consisted of a wheat or corn tortilla, ground meat and toppings such as diced tomatoes and lettuce. Tacos which are also a handheld meal were popular for the same reasons. Both tacos and hotdogs have a very similar base to their recipe. The bottom of both is made of a bread like bun or tortilla, and the both fold half way to be eaten open side up.  
</p>
		<p>Furthermore, after long research I do believe that the hotdog is actually closer to a taco. The taco itself follows the same recipe as a hotdog; the base bun or tortilla, the meat and then the toppings. The overall concept of a taco is much more alike to the hotdogs in the way it is built up during a meal as well. The base and the meat is placed and the toppings are to the choice of whoever will be enjoying the meal. For a hotdog to be a sandwich, the buns would have to be separated and although some hotdog buns do come in the pre separated two piece set it is not the traditional hotdog. Therefore, I have concluded that hotdog are no sandwich even though many speculate that the simple fact that it has a bread outside layer makes it the latter. The taco is far more similar to the hot dog in its overall concept and integrity, hence, a hotdog is a taco.
